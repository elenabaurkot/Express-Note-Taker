This appication uses the node.js express package, make sure to run the command "npm install" in the terminal to download express from the package.json file. Once it is installed you can run the app with the command "node server" or "nodemon server" (recomended method). Using nodemon is prefered as it will restart the server automaticly when new data is added or removed from the server.
